This it the webpage of the BBSRC-funded project to run between January 2018 and December 2020 (extended until August 2021). The project is a collaboration between the University of Birmingham, the University of Nottingham, and Procter & Gamble.
It involves 3 work packages:
<ul>
<li>WP1 focuses on psychophysics and modelling of texture discrimination.</li>

<li>WP2 centres on brain function through functional imaging and electrical stimulation.</li>

<li>WP3 translates the research findings into understanding in the applied context of discriminating changes in surface coating due to the use of surfactants (washing up liquid) to remove grease and deposits when hand washing plates. WP3 is being run in collaboration with Procter &amp; Gamble BIC.</li>
</ul>
