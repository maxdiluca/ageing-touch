abstract: This report presents the experimental methodology and a step-by-step guide for gathering data on how aging influences tactile surface perception in decision and action. The experiments consist of a set of trials in which the ability to distinguish tactile stimuli is investigated. A robot arm is used to provide a systematic and unbiased presentation of the stimuli.
