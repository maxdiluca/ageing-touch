Dr Allen is a psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist. She is interested in measures the neural processes of combining sensory information. Recent research has found differences in the relationship between perception and attention in obesity, autism, and ageing and has applied this to human factors, vehicle design, and the everyday environment. She is particularly interested in how information from different senses is combined and if this changes over the lifespan.
